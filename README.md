# Pacmen-Exercise
A web application that allows the user to put new Pacmen on the screen and they will move across the screen when play is pressed.

How to run: 
To add pacmen to the screen press "Add PacMan". To get the pacmen moving press "Start Game".

Roadmap of future improvements:
I plan to continue working on this by making this more like the Pacman game where the Pacmen move through a maze. This would involve possibly making a grid and using different sized sections to make the maze.
